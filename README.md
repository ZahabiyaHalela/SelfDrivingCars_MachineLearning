# Training a Car to identify signboards ! 

Autonomous vehicles has been the talk of the town for quite some time and well why not ! With machines coming close to replacing humans in several aspects - It would be safe to say that machine learning algorithms and autonomous vehicles are the future of transportation. I jumped on the bandwagon and tried to explore a self driving car image data set. Autonomous vehicles recognise traffic signals and signposts on the streets using a field of artificial intelligence known as computer vision (CV). After these images are recognised and collected using CV, we use machine learning algorithms to distinguish images from each other. The dataset I used has three different types of images in it and we were required to train models to make a machine understand and distinguish the pictures collected by the self driving carâ€™s cameras. 

I wanted to try out different types of models, and compare performance measures on them.  

Steps I took are below  : 
- Import dataset in R
- EDA
- Data visualization with ggplot2 to understand data better
- Data cleaning and pre processing
- Feature engineering
- Train test split
- k-fold Cross Validation in r
- Knn classification model, decision tree model and the random forest model
- Performance measures for all models
